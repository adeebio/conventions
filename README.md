When starting a new project, knowing what conventions to adhere to can be
frustrating. There are often more than one prospective set of conventions for
each programming language and the conventions between languages are almost
always different. For this reason, a set of conventions have been assembled that
are to be used no matter what programming language is being used. This has the
advantage that when a new project is started, there is no time or energy spent
on deciding what set of conventions to use. In addition, it has the benifit that
there is cross-language convention consistency. This is nice in projects where
there is more than one language being used and also keeps conventions to bear in
mind to a minimum.

The conventions are split into two groups, the _essential conventions_ and the
_additional conventions_. The essential conventions are regarded as the ones you
need to adhere to from the beginning. Correcting for these conventions at a
later date might not be simple. The additional conventions are regarded as the
ones that you can correct for at a later date, without too much trouble. So to
get up and running with these conventions as quickly as possible, read all the
essential conventions and then get going. Later, read and adopt the additional
conventions. Work that does not adhere to the essential conventions should be
corrected immediately. Work that does not adhere to the essential conventions
should be corrected when convenient.
