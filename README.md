The conventions are split into two groups, the _essential conventions_ and the
_additional conventions_. The essential conventions are regarded as the ones you
need to adhere to from the beginning. Correcting for these conventions at a
later date might not be simple. The additional conventions are regarded as the
ones that you can correct for at a later date, without too much trouble. So to
get up and running with these conventions as quickly as possible, read all the
essential conventions and then get going. Later, read and adopt the additional
conventions. Work that does not adhere to the essential conventions should be
corrected immediately. Work that does not adhere to the essential conventions
should be corrected when convenient.
