# Conventions

Choosing a set of conventions for a (new or existing) software project can be
frustrating. There are often more than one prospective set of conventions for
each programming language and the conventions between languages are almost
always different. For this reason, proposed here is a set of conventions that
should be viable no matter what programming language is being used. Adopting
such a universal set of conventions has the following benefits:

- When starting a new project, possibly in a new language, no time needs to be
spent on deciding what set of conventions to use.
- There is a consistency in the conventions used between languages. This is
particularly nice in projects where there is more than one language being used.
- It keeps the amount of conventions to have in mind to a minimum.

The conventions are split into two groups, the _essential conventions_ and the
_additional conventions_. The essential conventions are regarded as the ones you
need to adhere to from the beginning. Correcting for these conventions at a
later date might not be simple. The additional conventions are regarded as the
ones that you can correct for at a later date, without too much trouble. So to
get up and running with these conventions as quickly as possible, read all the
essential conventions and then get going. Later, read and adopt the additional
conventions. Work that does not adhere to the essential conventions should be
corrected immediately. Work that does not adhere to the additional conventions
should be corrected when convenient.
