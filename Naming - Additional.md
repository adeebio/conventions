# Naming - Additional

### File, directory, name and path

- File name
    - filename
    - fin
- Directory name
    - dirname
    - din
- File path
    - filepath
    - fip
- Directory Path
    - dirpath
    - dip
    
.

- paths should begin with one of the following:
    - `\` - Root of the current drive.
    - `.\` - Current directory.
    - `..\` - Parent of the current directory.
- Directory paths should not end in a delimiting character, e.g. `/`, `\`, etc.

### Let identifier names breathe

Naming identifiers in an expanded, rather than compacted, way, makes them easier
to read and understand. For example:

- Example 1:
    - Compacted: `checkAndRespondToAChangeMachineStateRequest()`
    - Expanded: `checkAndRespondToARequestToChangeTheMachineState()`
