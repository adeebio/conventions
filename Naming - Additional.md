# Naming - Additional

### Let identifier names breathe

Naming identifiers in an expanded, rather than compacted, way, makes them easier
to read and understand. For example:

- Example 1:
    - Compacted: `checkAndRespondToAChangeMachineStateRequest()`
    - Expanded: `checkAndRespondToARequestToChangeTheMachineState()`
