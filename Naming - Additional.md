# Naming - Additional

### Let function names breathe

Naming functions in an expanded, rather than compacted, way, makes them easier
to read and understand. For example:

- Example 1:
    - Compacted: `checkAndRespondToAChangeAxisStateRequest()`
    - Expanded: `checkAndRespondToARequestToChangeTheAxisState()`
