- Keeps the words on either side distinct.
- Should replace spaces where when they would have ordinarily been used.
- Can be mistaken for subtraction (hence not allowed as variable names in some languages.
- Used for:
  - Folder names.
  - File named not named after internal code content.

### Underscore:

- Merges the two words on either side.
- Should be used when creating something that should be considered one entity, e.g. a variable name.
- Used for:
  - Variable / function / Class names.
  - File names named after internal code content.
  - Groupings, in code and otherwise.
